<h1>Hey there!</h1>
<hr/>

<h4>Nice too meet you! My name is Gabriela Ares</h4>

<p> I'm a 30-year-old from Brazil who has been living in the UK for the past 4 years.
I have a real passion for language and communication, and even though English is my second language. <br>
I'm totally committed to learning and improving. I love taking on new challenges, whether it's learning new languages, getting lost in a good book, or exploring the world of web development.<br>
Right now, I'm focused on becoming a skilled web developer. I'm dedicated to studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm excited about all the possibilities that web development has to offer. I can't wait to bring my creativity and determination to this exciting field!</p>
